# Apple News Welcome Message

## Synopsis

This is a demo of an onboarding screen for an app based on the iOS News app's onboarding screen, which consists of a blank screen that shows text un-blur and fade-in. [Click here to see a live demo.](https://dombrant.github.io/apple-news-welcome-message/)

**Warning:** This works best in Firefox and Safari. In Chrome, there appears to be a bug where the text scales back to its original size after the animation is complete. See [issue #1.](https://github.com/dombrant/apple-news-welcome-message/issues/1)
